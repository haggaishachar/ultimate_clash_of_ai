### Deterministic Question Evaluation Checklist

Evaluate if the question is deterministic using the following criteria:

1. **Objective Basis:** Is the question based on objective facts?
2. **Absence of Subjectivity:** Can it be answered without subjective judgment?
3. **Consistency:** Does the answer remain the same regardless of interpretation?
4. **Verifiability:** Can the answer be verified through reliable sources or established facts?

**Scoring:**
- Provide a confidence score from **0 to 10**, where:
  - **10** = Highly deterministic
  - **0** = Completely non-deterministic

**Important:** Respond with a **single number** between 0 and 10, with **no additional text**.
