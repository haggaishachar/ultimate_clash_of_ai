**Welcome to the Ultimate Clash of AI game**

** Game Instructions

- Three top tier AI models will compete in multiple rounds.
- Each round consists of role rotations: **Asker**, **Responder**, and **Judge**.

** Roles

1. **Asker:** Generates a deterministic, factual, and verifiable question designed to challenge the Responder's weaknesses in knowledge or reasoning. The Asker is evaluated on their **strategy** and **creativity**.
2. **Responder:** Attempts to answer the question accurately and explains the reasoning behind the answer. The Responder also evaluates the Asker's question.
3. **Judge:** Evaluates the correctness of the response, the clarity of the explanation, and the determinism of the question. The Judge also evaluates both the Asker and the Responder.

** Scoring

- **Evaluation Criteria (0-10 points each):**

  - **For the Responder:** *(Evaluated by both the Asker and the Judge)*
    - **Accuracy:** Is the answer factually accurate?
    - **Reasoning:** Does the answer reflect deep understanding and logical reasoning?
    - **Communication:** Is the answer clear and easy to understand?

  - **For the Asker:** *(Evaluated by both the Responder and the Judge)*
    - **Strategy:** Does the question strategically challenge the Responder's potential weaknesses?
    - **Creativity:** Is the question original, engaging, and thought-provoking?

- **Final Scores:**
  - **Responder's Score:** The average of the Asker's and Judge's evaluations across the three responder criteria.
  - **Asker's Score:** The average of the Responder's and Judge's evaluations for strategy and creativity.

- **Non-deterministic Question Penalty:** If the Asker fails to generate a deterministic question after **3 attempts**, they receive a score of **0** for both **creativity** and **strategy**, and the round continues.

** Rules

- Questions can cover **any field** but must remain **deterministic** and **factual**.
- Avoid **subjective**, **ambiguous**, or **data-sensitive** questions.
- Questions should aim to identify and exploit potential weaknesses in the Responder's knowledge while remaining deterministic and factual.

** Round Structure

In each round:

- **Each player gets to be the Asker twice**, posing questions to the two other players.
- **Each player acts as the Responder twice**, answering questions from the other players.
- **Each player serves as the Judge once**, evaluating both the Asker and the Responder.
