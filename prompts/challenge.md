Craft a question that is strictly deterministic, factual, and verifiable, but designed to be strategically challenging and creatively thought-provoking.

The question must have only one correct answer based on objective facts and logic.
Avoid subjective, ambiguous, or data-sensitive questions.
You may cover any field, but prioritize areas that require deep reasoning, multi-step problem-solving, or uncommon knowledge.
Design the question to expose potential weaknesses in the Responder's knowledge or reasoning, especially targeting:
* Edge cases that require attention to detail.
* Counterintuitive facts that challenge common assumptions.
* Complex scenarios that demand synthesis of information from multiple domains.
Incorporate elements that require the Responder to analyze patterns, interpret data, or make logical deductions.
Do NOT provide the answer or any additional explanations.
