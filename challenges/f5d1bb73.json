Here's the reasoning using the pigeonhole principle:\n\n1. **Consider one vertex (let's call it vertex A).**  Vertex A is connected to five other vertices. Each of these edges is either red or blue.\n\n2. **Pigeonhole Principle:** Since there are only two colors and five edges, at least three of the edges connected to vertex A must be the same color.

            "content": "The reasoning is a solid application of the pigeonhole principle and case analysis. Here's a breakdown of why it works:\n\n* **The Key Idea:** The core idea is to focus on one vertex and its connections to the rest of the graph.  Because K6 is a complete graph (every vertex is connected to every other vertex), choosing any vertex gives us a rich set of connections to analyze.\n\n* **Pigeonhole Principle Application (Step 2):** This is the crucial step.  We have 5 edges originating from our chosen vertex (A).  These edges are our \"pigeons,\" and the two colors (red and blue) are our \"holes.\"  Since we have more pigeons than holes (5 > 2), the pigeonhole principle guarantees that at least one hole must contain at least \u23085/2\u2309 = 3 pigeons. In other words, at least three edges connected to vertex A must be the same color.\n\n* **Exhaustive Case Analysis (Step 3):**  This step cleverly examines all the possibilities for the connections between the three vertices (B, C, and D) that are connected to A by the same color edges.  There are only two possibilities: at least one of the edges between B, C, and D is the same color as the edges connecting them to A, or all of those edges are the *other* color.  Both cases result in a monochromatic triangle.\n\n* **Why it works for K6 but not necessarily smaller complete graphs:**  K6 provides enough connections to guarantee the existence of the three same-colored edges from vertex A.  If we tried this with K5, we could only guarantee two same-colored edges, and that's not enough to guarantee a monochromatic triangle in all cases.  You could color a K5 without a monochromatic triangle (try it!).\n\nIn summary, the argument demonstrates that no matter how you try to 2-color the edges of a K6 graph, you'll inevitably create a monochromatic triangle.  The pigeonhole principle helps us narrow down the possibilities to a manageable set of cases, which we then analyze exhaustively to reach our conclusion.\n"

Here's why:\n\n1) In a perfect out-shuffle, the cards are split exactly in half (26 and 26), and then interleaved perfectly with the original top card remaining on top.\n\n2) Each card's position after a shuffle can be calculated using the formula:\n   - If position p < 26: new position = 2p\n   - If position p \u2265 26: new position = 2p + 1 (mod 51)\n\n3) This creates a permutation that, when repeated, will eventually return to the original order.\n\n4) The number 8 is significant because:\n   - 2\u2078 \u2261 1 (mod 52)\n   - This means after 8 perfect out-shuffles, each card returns to its original position\n\nThe arrangement doesn't matter because this is a property of the shuffle itself, not the initial card order. Any initial arrangement will return to its original order after exactly 8 perfect out-shuffles.\n\nThis is a mathematically proven result first published by Solomon Golomb in 1961, and it relates to multiplicative group theory and the order of 2 modulo 52."

In the RGB color model, white is represented by the hex code #FFFFFF, which corresponds to the maximum value (255) for each of the red, green, and blue color channels.\n\nTo find the complementary color of an RGB hex color, you need to find a color that, when combined with the original, results in white (#FFFFFF). This is achieved by subtracting each of the original color's RGB components from 255. Let's examine the process step by step, using the example provided:\n\n1. **Convert Hex to Decimal:**\n   - The original hex color #7B2F8E is broken down into its RGB components:\n     - Red component: 7B in hexadecimal is 123 in decimal.\n     - Green component: 2F in hexadecimal is 47 in decimal.\n     - Blue component: 8E in hexadecimal is 142 in decimal.\n\n2. **Calculate the Complementary Components:**\n   - For each color component, subtract the decimal value from 255 to find the complementary value:\n     - Complementary Red = 255 - 123 = 132\n     - Complementary Green = 255 - 47 = 208\n     - Complementary Blue = 255 - 142 = 113\n\n3. **Convert Decimal Back to Hex:**\n   - Convert the complementary component values from decimal back to hexadecimal:\n     - Complementary Red: 132 in decimal is 84 in hexadecimal.\n     - Complementary Green: 208 in decimal is D0 in hexadecimal.\n     - Complementary Blue: 113 in decimal is 71 in hexadecimal.\n\n4. **Form the Complementary Hex Code:**\n   - Combine the complementary hexadecimal values to form the complete complementary color code:\n     - The complementary color is #84D071.\n\nThis method effectively calculates the RGB color that provides visual contrast to the original by theoretically combining with it to make white. Each step in this process was correctly executed, leading to the correct complementary color code of #84D071.

Let's break down the logic step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Deck Composition**: \n   - A standard deck of 52 cards includes face cards (Jack, Queen, King) for each suit. We remove these, leaving us with four suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades), each containing only cards from Ace to 10. This results in 10 cards per suit.\n\n2. **Deck Sequence Order**:\n   - The cards are arranged first by suit in the order: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades. Within each suit, the cards are ordered from Ace to 10.\n   - Total cards = 4 suits * 10 cards = 40 cards.\n\n3. **Locating the 25th Card**:\n   - Clubs (first suit) cover positions 1 to 10.\n   - Diamonds (second suit) cover positions 11 to 20.\n   - Hearts (third suit) cover positions 21 to 30.\n\n4. **Identifying the 25th Card**:\n   - The range 21 to 30 corresponds to Hearts.\n   - Within Hearts, the sequence is Ace = 21, 2 = 22, 3 = 23, 4 = 24, 5 = 25.\n   - Therefore, the 25th card is the 5 of Hearts.\n\nYour detailed explanation includes building the sequence by counting through the suits and positions correctly based on the constraints given (no face cards), leading to the accurate determination that the 25th card is the 5 of Hearts."

The problem provides the distance (300 miles) and information about the changing speed, requiring us to solve for the time.  The key steps in the reasoning are:\n\n1. **Variable Definition:** Clearly defining variables helps organize the information and makes the equations easier to construct.\n2. **Equation Setup:** We use the distance formula to create two equations, one for the outbound trip and one for the return trip. The return trip equation reflects the 25% speed reduction (0.75v) and the increased time (t + 2).\n3. **Substitution and Simplification:**  Solving for 't' in the first equation allows us to substitute it into the second equation, eliminating one variable and making the equation solvable for 'v'.\n4. **Solving for 'v':**  This is standard algebraic manipulation to isolate the 'v' variable and find the original speed.\n5. **Calculating Individual Trip Times:**  Once 'v' is known, we can easily calculate the time for each trip using the distance formula.\n6. **Calculating Total Round Trip Time:**  Simply adding the individual trip times gives the total round trip time.\n\n\n**Evaluation Reasoning:**\n\n* **Strategy (10/10):**  The question is well-designed to test problem-solving.

This forces the solver to think more carefully about how to set up the equations and manage the change in speed. It isn't entirely novel, but it takes a standard problem type and tweaks it enough to make it more engaging and challenging.

As the black hole's accretion disk rotates at extremely high speeds, the material moving towards us appears brighter due to the Doppler effect.

This extensive collaboration allowed astronomers to achieve the high resolution necessary to image the black hole in the center of galaxy M87.\n\n2. **Asymmetric Brightness and Relativistic Beaming:** The asymmetric brightness pattern observed in the image is a result of relativistic beaming, a relativistic effect predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. As material in the black hole's accretion disk orbits at incredibly high speeds close to the speed of light, the portion of the disk moving towards the observer appears brighter due to the Doppler effect. This is because the motion towards the observer increases the frequency of the light (a blueshift), resulting in enhanced brightness.\n\n3. **Gravitational Lensing and Light Warping:** The intense gravitational field around the black hole causes gravitational lensing, bending the path of light and further influencing the appearance of the accretion disk. This phenomenon, combined with relativistic Doppler effects, results in the characteristic ring structure and the brightness asymmetry in the observed image.\n\nIn summary, the interpretation of the image relies on understanding how relativistic physics affects the light emitted by materials around a black hole and how these effects, combined with advanced observational technology, allow us to visualize phenomena occurring at astonishing distances and scales."

Therefore, 1 sunrise and 1 sunset per Zog year is the correct answer.\n"

Draw a few circles tangent to each other as described, and then connect their centers. You'll observe the hexagonal pattern forming.\n\n2. **Focusing on a Single Hexagon:** Now, consider one hexagon in this pattern.  Each of its six vertices represents the center of a circle. However, each circle is shared by three hexagons.  This can be visualized by drawing the hexagons surrounding the initial hexagon.\n\n3. **Counting Circles and Hexagons:**  If we were to count six circles for each hexagon, we'd be overcounting.  Since each circle contributes to three hexagons, we effectively have 6 circles / 3 hexagons per circle = 2 circles per hexagon.\n\n4. **Extending to Infinity:** This relationship holds true regardless of how many hexagons we consider. As the tiling extends infinitely, the 2:1 ratio remains constant.  Every circle is always shared by three hexagons, and every hexagon always has six circle centers as vertices.\n\n5. **Formalizing with Euler's Characteristic (Optional, but adds rigor):**  While not strictly necessary for this problem,  consider a finite patch of this tiling. Euler's characteristic for a planar graph (V - E + F = 1, where V is vertices, E is edges, and F is faces) can also be used to derive this relationship by carefully considering the vertices, edges, and faces (hexagons) formed by the circles and their connections. However, the simpler visualization and counting argument is sufficient and easier to follow.\n\n\nTherefore, the ratio of circles to hexagons in this infinite tiling is 2:1.\n"

Here's a breakdown of why the logic works:\n\n* **The core idea is about shared circles.** The explanation correctly identifies that simply counting six circles per hexagon is wrong because each circle is part of three hexagons. This sharing is the key to understanding the problem.\n\n* **Visualization is crucial.**  Encouraging the reader to draw a small section of the tiling and see how the circles and hexagons relate is very helpful.  This makes the abstract concept of an infinite tiling more concrete.\n\n* **Focusing on a single hexagon simplifies the problem.** By analyzing one hexagon and its surrounding neighbors, the explanation isolates the crucial relationship: six circle centers form the vertices, but each circle belongs to three such hexagons.\n\n* **The division by 3 is the critical step.**  Recognizing that each circle's \"contribution\" must be divided by 3 (because it's shared) is what leads to the correct 2:1 ratio.\n\n* **Extending to infinity is a necessary point.** The problem specifies an infinite tiling, so the explanation correctly emphasizes that this 2:1 relationship holds no matter how large the tiling grows.\n\n* **Euler's Characteristic is a more advanced approach.** While the visual/counting method is sufficient, mentioning Euler's Characteristic demonstrates a deeper understanding and offers a more formal (though more complex) way to prove the relationship.  It correctly notes that this is optional.\n\nIn summary, the explanation uses a clear, logical progression from visualization to a simple counting argument to establish the 2:1 ratio.  It effectively conveys the key insight of shared circles and ensures the reader understands why the initial intuitive answer (6:1) is incorrect.\n"
