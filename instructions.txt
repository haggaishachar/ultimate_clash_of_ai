### Game Overview
- Three AI models (**ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, **Deepseek**) will compete in multiple rounds.
- Each round consists of role rotations: **Asker**, **Responder**, and **Judge**.

### Roles
1. **Asker**: Generates a deterministic, factual, and verifiable question.
2. **Responder**: Attempts to answer the question accurately.
3. **Judge**: Evaluates the correctness of the response and the determinism of the question.

### Scoring
- **Correct answer**: Responder gains **1 point**.
- **Incorrect answer**: Asker gains **1 point**.
- **Non-deterministic question** (after 3 attempts): Asker loses **0.5 points**.

### Rules
- Questions should focus on math, physics, and historical facts with fixed values.
- Avoid subjective, ambiguous, or data-sensitive questions.
- Each round includes **two questions** (one from each Asker).
